# Tree_Distribution_Database
Repository for curating occurrence and predictor data of tree distributions

All scripts are located in folder scripts

## scripts folder
Within folder "scripts", files have been numbered in the order they are to be used in the workflow.

 Occurrence data for our oak species of interest has been downloaded prior to its use in our scripts. 
   None of the data comes from API currently, but we hope to update these file paths when API becomes available, we hope.

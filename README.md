# Tree_Distribution_Database
Repository for curating occurrence and predictor data of tree distributions

# All scripts are located in folder scripts

# Within folder "scripts", files have been numbered in the order they are to be used.
#
# Occurrence data for our oak species of interest has been downloaded prior to its use in our scripts. 
#   None of the data comes from API currently, but we hope to update these file paths when API becomes available, we hope.
